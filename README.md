# Better Teams

Better Teams is a Chrome Extension that supercharges your Microsoft Teams experience! Whether you're sharing media, reacting to a call, or avoiding notification pop-ups, Better Teams has your back. Seamlessly embed media, improve usability, and enjoy a more polished Teams interface.

## üåü Features

### **Enhanced Call Reactions**: 
Move reaction buttons out of the popup menu and onto the call action bar. This helps you avoid the dreaded ‚ÄúRaise Hand‚Äù mistake when all you wanted to do was react with a üëç or üëè.

**Reactions are now away from "raise hand"**:

### **Relocated Notifications**: 
Notifications are relocated so they won‚Äôt block any critical buttons or text fields, ensuring you always have a clear view of what matters.
