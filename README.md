# Better Teams

Better Teams is a Chrome Extension that supercharges your Microsoft Teams experience! Whether you're sharing media, reacting to a call, or avoiding notification pop-ups, Better Teams has your back. Seamlessly embed media, improve accessibility, and enjoy a more polished Teams interface.

## 🌟 Features

- **Spotify Integration**: Share Spotify links, and Better Teams will embed a playable media player directly in your chat. No need to leave the conversation to jam to your favorite tunes!
- **YouTube & Shorts Integration**: Share YouTube videos or Shorts, and they’ll play right within the chat. No more navigating away from your conversation to watch videos.
- **Twitter Embeds**: Instantly resolve tweets and display them with full media (images, videos) directly in your message feed.
- **Enhanced Call Reactions**: Move reaction buttons out of the popup menu and onto the call action bar. This helps you avoid the dreaded “Raise Hand” mistake when all you wanted to do was react with a 👍 or 🎉.
- **Smart Notifications**: Notifications are relocated so they won’t block any critical buttons or text fields, ensuring you always have a clear view of what matters.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
4. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the cloned repository folder.
5. That’s it! Better Teams is now installed and ready to enhance your Teams experience.

## 💡 Usage

1. Open Microsoft Teams in your Google Chrome browser.
2. Share a YouTube video, tweet, or Spotify link in your Teams chat.
3. Better Teams will automatically detect the media and embed it directly in the conversation for a seamless experience.
4. In a call? Use the newly placed reaction buttons, far away from the "Raise Hand" button for easier, mistake-free reactions!
